# -Singapore-Resale-Flat-Prices-Predicting
The Singapore Resale Flat Prices Prediction Project develops a machine learning model to estimate HDB flat resale prices based on historical data. It provides a user-friendly web application for buyers and sellers to make informed decisions in Singapore’s real estate market.

Problem Statement:
Estimating the resale value of flats in Singapore is a complex task influenced by various factors such as location, flat type, floor area, and lease duration. This project addresses the challenge by creating a reliable machine learning model that predicts resale prices accurately. The solution benefits users by reducing uncertainty and aiding informed decision-making.

Scope and Methodology:
The project involves the following steps:

Data Collection & Preprocessing: Historical resale transaction data is collected from data.gov.sg. The data is cleaned and structured for analysis.
Feature Engineering: Key attributes such as town, flat type, storey range, floor area, and lease commence date are analyzed and enhanced to improve model performance.
Model Development & Evaluation: Machine learning models, including linear regression and decision trees, are trained on the prepared dataset. Performance metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) are used to assess accuracy.
Web Application Development: A web application built using Streamlit enables users to input flat details and obtain predicted prices in real time.
Deployment & Testing: The application is deployed on platforms like Render to ensure accessibility, with extensive testing for accuracy and usability.
Deliverables:
The outcomes include a high-performing predictive model, a functional web application, and thorough documentation detailing the development process. The project emphasizes clean, modular coding practices and a public GitHub repository for transparency and collaboration.

Impact:
This project streamlines price estimation in Singapore’s housing market, empowering users with data-driven insights. Additionally, it showcases the practical application of machine learning in solving real-world problems within the real estate domain.
